## Description
This repository contains Java classes for performing operations on polynomials. The `App` class serves as a demonstration of polynomial addition, subtraction, and differentiation. The `Polynom` class represents polynomials and provides methods to perform arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, and differentiation.


## Files

1. **App.java**: Contains the `main` method to demonstrate polynomial operations. It prompts the user to input coefficients and powers for two polynomials and then performs addition, subtraction, and differentiation operations on them.

2. **Polynom.java**: Implements the `Polynom` class, which represents polynomials and provides methods for polynomial arithmetic operations. This class includes methods for addition, subtraction, differentiation, and displaying polynomials as strings.
